# What is ToiletPaper?
Its a Paper fork without some "features".  
Perfect for a minigame server.

[Download latest jar](https://github.com/NextFightNetwork/ToiletPaper/releases/download/1.3.1/ToiletPaper-1.20.2-v1.3.1.jar)

# What is different?
- Removed command aliases
- Removed eula.txt
- Reduced console logs
- Disabled timings
- Increased required permission level of some commands like /plugins or /version
- Improved tps command
- Added toiletpaper.yml
- Added auto downloaded plugins (which can be disabled in toiletpaper.yml)
  - AntiPopup (No chat report)

### Changed default options in some configs
> **Important**
> These will only be applied if files like the `server.properties` or `bukkit/spigot.yml` file are generated by PaperToilet
  - Disabled end
  - Disabled nether
  - Disabled advancements
  - Disabled player stats saving
  - Disabled enforce secure player profile

## Config
`toiletpaper.yml`
```yml
Option:
  DisableWorldSaving: true
  DisableVersionCommandArgs: true
  DisableAllCommands: false
  AutoDownloadPlugins: true
DownloadPlugins:
  AntiPopup-7_1_jar:
    NAME: AntiPopup-7.1.jar
    URL: https://nextfight.net/public/toiletpaper/plugins/AntiPopup-7.1.jar
```

> **Note**  
> If you have set `DisableWorldSaving` to true  
> no world will be saved which means your world will be resetet after a restart  
> you can still use the `/save-all` command to save your progress  

## TODO
- Option to disable all default commands for player
- Option to not show player IP's in console
- Option to disable logs / minimal logs
- Less config files

You can still write plugins using the normal paper api but some features will be missing like the player statistics
